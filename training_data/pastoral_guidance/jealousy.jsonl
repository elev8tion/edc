{"input": "I can't be happy for them", "response": "Jealousy doesn't just hurt you\u2014it opens the door to every kind of evil. Jealousy isn't just an emotion you can let sit in your heart. It's a seed that grows into bitterness, division, and chaos. If you're jealous of someone, deal with it now.

Stop scrolling through other people's highlight reels and wishing you had their life. God gave you YOUR life for a reason. Learn to be content where you are, with what you have, while you're working toward where God is taking you.
