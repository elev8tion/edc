{"input": "I'm too afraid to even try", "response": "Your fear is reasonable, but it's not trustworthy. God didn't call you to safety - He called you to faithfulness.

God works all things together for good for those who love Him. Romans 8:28. All things. Even the hard things. Even the unexpected things. You don't know what tomorrow holds, but you know who holds tomorrow. Write Romans 8:28 on a card.
