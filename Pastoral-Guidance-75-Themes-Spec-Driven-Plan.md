# 📖 Pastoral Guidance AI - 75 Extended Themes - Spec-Driven Development Plan

**Version:** 1.0
**Created:** October 8, 2025
**Project:** Biblical Pastoral Guidance System with WEB Bible Integration
**Scope:** 75 Life Themes (26 Critical Spiritual + 32 Everyday American Life + 12 Cultural/Identity + 5 Foundational)

---

## 📋 SPECIFY.MD - Project Specification

### What We're Building

A comprehensive pastoral guidance system that delivers **authentic biblical counsel** in your established pastoral tone across 75 real-world life struggles, powered by:
- Your trained pastoral voice model (tone, delivery, empathy)
- WEB Bible database integration (World English Bible - public domain)
- Scripture-backed responses for contemporary American challenges
- Theologically sound guidance without religious platitudes

### Why This Matters

**Current State (The Gap):**
- ⚠️ Existing model trained on 7 themes (anxiety, grief, anger, jealousy, loneliness, forgiveness, provision)
- ⚠️ Missing 68 critical life struggles Americans face daily
- ⚠️ No coverage for: addiction, depression, suicidal ideation, financial crisis, career burnout, family trauma
- ⚠️ No guidance for modern issues: social media addiction, climate anxiety, political division, AI anxiety
- ⚠️ Limited to general struggles, not specific contexts (e.g., "anxiety" but not "panic attacks" or "GAD")

**Desired State (The Solution):**
- ✅ 75 themes covering entire spectrum of human suffering in 2025 America
- ✅ Each theme has 200-300 scripture-backed pastoral responses in your voice
- ✅ Contextualized guidance (e.g., "unemployment" addresses identity in work, not just "trust God")
- ✅ Culturally relevant (addresses technology addiction, political division, student debt)
- ✅ Theologically nuanced (e.g., healing theology for illness, remarriage after divorce)
- ✅ WEB Bible citations for every response (book, chapter, verse)

**Target Users:**
- Christians struggling with real-world pain (not just "spiritual" issues)
- Young adults (Millennials/Gen Z) with student debt, delayed adulthood, climate anxiety
- Parents facing burnout, blended family dynamics, prodigal children
- Workers experiencing burnout, workplace toxicity, career uncertainty
- Individuals with mental health struggles (depression, anxiety disorders, PTSD)
- Those facing financial crisis (54% of Americans report money as #1 stressor)

### Success Criteria

1. **Theme Coverage:** All 75 themes have dedicated pastoral guidance content
2. **Response Volume:** 250 responses per theme (75 × 250 = 18,750 total)
3. **Scripture Integration:** Every response includes WEB Bible verse with context
4. **Pastoral Voice Consistency:** 95%+ match to your trained model's tone/delivery
5. **Theological Soundness:** Independent theological review passes 90%+ accuracy
6. **Contextual Relevance:** Responses address specific struggle, not generic "pray more" advice
7. **American Life Accuracy:** Statistics/context reflect current US reality (2025 data)

### Non-Goals (Out of Scope)

- ❌ Medical/clinical diagnosis (we say "see a therapist," not diagnose PTSD)
- ❌ Legal advice (divorce, immigration - direct to professionals)
- ❌ Political advocacy (address political division, not endorse candidates)
- ❌ Debate theology (e.g., LGBTQ+ - offer pastoral care, not theological arguments)
- ❌ Replace human pastors (this is supplemental guidance, not primary counseling)
- ❌ Crisis intervention (suicidal ideation responses include 988 hotline)

## 🛠 PLAN.MD - Technical Implementation Plan

### Tech Stack

**Core Components:**
- **Pastoral Voice Model:** Your pre-trained model (tone, delivery, empathy patterns)
- **Bible Database:** WEB Bible (World English Bible) - full text, searchable
- **Scripture Mapping Engine:** Theme → relevant verses (semantic search or pre-mapped)
- **Response Generator:** Model + WEB verses → pastoral guidance in your voice
- **Quality Validator:** Theological review, tone check, scripture accuracy

**Development Tools:**
- Python 3.10+
- Bible API or local WEB Bible JSON/SQLite database
- Your pastoral model (assume fine-tuned LSTM or transformer)
- Libraries: `sqlite3` (Bible DB), `jsonlines` (data), `sentence-transformers` (verse search)

**Data Storage:**
- Format: JSONL (one response per line)
- Structure:

#### Task A1: WEB Bible Database Setup
**Status:** ⬜ Not Started
**Owner:** Primary Agent
**Estimated Time:** 2 hours

**Steps:**
1. Download WEB Bible corpus (public domain - available at ebible.org or bible-api)
2. Create SQLite database:
   ```sql
   CREATE TABLE verses (
     id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY,
     book TEXT NOT NULL,
     chapter INTEGER NOT NULL,
     verse INTEGER NOT NULL,
     text TEXT NOT NULL,
     testament TEXT CHECK(testament IN ('OT', 'NT'))
   );
   CREATE INDEX idx_book_chapter_verse ON verses(book, chapter, verse);
   ```
3. Load WEB Bible into database (66 books, 31,102 verses)
4. Create searchable index (full-text search for verse lookup)
5. **Hook:** Update progress → "WEB Bible database loaded: 31,102 verses ✓"

**Script to Run:**
```python
python scripts/01_setup_web_bible_database.py \
  --source https://ebible.org/web/web-all.json \
  --output bible_database/web_bible.sqlite
```

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- SQLite database contains 31,102 verses
- All 66 books present (39 OT, 27 NT)
- Full-text search functional
- Test query: "SELECT * FROM verses WHERE book='Psalms' AND chapter=23" returns 6 verses

---

#### Task A2: Theme Definitions & Real User Language
**Status:** ⬜ Not Started
**Owner:** Primary Agent
**Estimated Time:** 4 hours

**Steps:**
1. Create `docs/theme_definitions.md` with all 75 themes
2. For each theme, document:
   - Definition (clinical, specific)
   - Statistics (prevalence in America 2025)
   - Real user language (how people actually describe this struggle)
   - Pastoral approach (how to address, what to avoid)
   - Theological nuances (if any - e.g., healing theology for illness)
3. **Hook:** After every 15 themes → "Completed definitions for {count} themes ✓"

**Template:**
```markdown
## Theme: Anxiety Disorders
**Definition:** Panic attacks, GAD, health anxiety, constant worry, physical symptoms (racing heart, shortness of breath, dizziness)
**Prevalence:** 42.5M Americans (19.1%) - ADAA 2023
**Real User Language:**
- "I can't breathe"
- "My heart won't stop racing"
- "I'm having a panic attack"
- "Everything feels out of control"
**Pastoral Approach:** Validate physical reality, provide grounding techniques, affirm God's presence in panic
**Avoid:** "Just pray harder," "Real faith = no anxiety," spiritual bypassing
**Theological Position:** Anxiety is not a sin; God meets us in mental illness
```

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- All 75 themes documented
- Statistics current (2023-2025 data)
- Real user language includes 5-10 phrases per theme
- Pastoral approach specific, not generic

---

#### Task A3: Theological Positions Document
**Status:** ⬜ Not Started
**Owner:** Primary Agent (with theological advisor if available)
**Estimated Time:** 3 hours

**Steps:**
1. Create `docs/theological_positions.md`
2. Document stance on nuanced topics:
   - Healing theology (Is sickness always from lack of faith?)
   - Divorce and remarriage (Biblical grounds, pastoral care)
   - LGBTQ+ struggles (Love person, care pastorally, avoid debate)
   - Spiritual warfare (Demonic oppression vs mental illness)
   - Unanswered prayer (Theodicy, God's sovereignty)
   - Prosperity gospel (Reject health/wealth gospel)
3. **Hook:** Update progress → "Theological positions documented ✓"

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- Clear stance on 10-15 controversial topics
- Rooted in scripture, not cultural trends
- Pastoral care prioritized over theological purity
- Reviewed by external theologian (if possible)

---

### CATEGORY B: THEME-VERSE MAPPING (Days 4-7)

**🎯 Goal:** Map each of 75 themes to 20-30 relevant WEB Bible verses

**⚡ SUBAGENT ORCHESTRATION PLAN:**
- Deploy 5 parallel subagents (one per theme tier)
- Each subagent maps their assigned themes to verses
- Total: 75 themes × 25 verses avg = 1,875 verse mappings

---

   - Document context (which Bible book, who's speaking, situation)
2. Save to `bible_database/theme_verse_mappings.json`
3. **Hook:** After each theme → "Mapped {theme}: {count} verses ✓"

**Script to Run:**
```python
python scripts/02_map_themes_to_verses.py \
  --themes-file docs/tier1_themes.txt \
  --bible-db bible_database/web_bible.sqlite \

## 📝 NOTES & ASSUMPTIONS

**Assumptions:**
- Your pastoral voice model is trained and accessible
- WEB Bible database available (public domain)
- External theologian available for Task F1 (optional but recommended)
- Crisis hotlines current as of 2025 (988 Lifeline, 741741 Crisis Text)

**Dependencies:**
- Python 3.10+
- Libraries: `sqlite3`, `jsonlines`, `sentence-transformers` (for verse search)
- Your trained pastoral model (LSTM or transformer)
- WEB Bible corpus (download from ebible.org)

**Risk Mitigation:**
- If theological review fails, iterate on flagged responses
- If voice consistency low, retrain on more of your examples
- If timeline too long, reduce responses per theme (250 → 150)
