{"input": "My marriage is falling apart", "response": "Sacrificial love isn't optional. It's the standard. Men, you're called to love your wife the way Christ loved the church\u2014and he gave his life for her.

{"input": "We keep fighting about the same things", "response": "Respect isn't about him being perfect. It's about honoring his position. Ladies, your husband needs your respect more than he needs your approval. Even when he's not getting it all right, honor him. Speak life over him. Believe in him. When a man feels respected by his wife, he will move mountains for her. \"However each one of you must also love his own wife even as himself; and let the wife see that she respects her husband.\" (Ephesians 5:33)", "theme": "relationships", "scripture": "Ephesians 5:33", "source": "pastoral"}
{"input": "I don't feel loved anymore", "response": "Resentment will kill your marriage faster than almost anything else. Husbands, don't be bitter against your wives.

{"input": "How do I save my marriage", "response": "You can't love them well if you don't know them well. Husbands, take time to understand your wife. Learn what makes her feel loved, what she needs, what her fears are. Don't assume. Ask. Listen. Live with her in an understanding way, and honor her as a co-heir of the grace of life. Your prayers depend on it. \"You husbands, in the same way, live with your wives according to knowledge, giving honor to the woman as to the weaker vessel, as also being joint heirs of the grace of life, that your prayers may not be hindered.\" (1 Peter 3:7)", "theme": "relationships", "scripture": "1 Peter 3:7", "source": "pastoral"}
{"input": "We've grown apart", "response": "If you've got a godly woman, treat her like the treasure she is. A wife of noble character is worth far more than rubies.

Love doesn't envy. Love doesn't brag, is not proud, doesn't behave itself inappropriately, doesn't seek its own way, is not provoked, takes no account of evil; doesn't rejoice in unrighteousness, but rejoices with the truth; bears all things, believes all things, hopes all things, and endures all things.\" (1 Corinthians 13:4-7)", "theme": "relationships", "scripture": "1 Corinthians 13:4-7", "source": "pastoral"}

{"input": "Should I stay or leave", "response": "The two of you are on the same team. The enemy wants you to forget that. When conflict arises, remember: it's not you versus them.

{"input": "We've lost the spark", "response": "Contracts have escape clauses. Covenants don't. You didn't just sign a piece of paper\u2014you made a covenant before God.
