## 📝 Example Quality Check

### **Anger (Excellent Quality)**
```
Input: "I can't let go of what they did"
Response: "Anger itself isn't the sin—it's what you do with it that counts.
It's okay to feel angry. Even Jesus got angry. But don't let that anger
control you. Don't let it make you say things you can't take back or do
things you'll regret. Feel the anger, bring it to God, and then let him
show you how to handle it righteously. 'Be angry, and don't sin. Don't
let the sun go down on your wrath.' (Ephesians 4:26)"
Theme: anger
Scripture: Ephesians 4:26
```

### **Identity (Excellent Quality)**
```
Input: "I don't know who I am"
Response: "Settle this first: God is for you, not against you; let that
truth change how you walk, talk, grieve, and celebrate. (See Rom 8:31;
1 Thess 4:13; Zech 4:6; Ps 124:1–2)"
Theme: identity
Scripture: Rom 8:31; Phil 2:13
```

### **Sin (Excellent Quality)**
```
Input: "I keep falling into the same sin"
Response: "Do not tolerate or hide sin in your life. Identify it, confess
it, and remove it completely. Don't make excuses or allow sin to remain
comfortable in your heart."
Theme: sin
Scripture: Matthew 5:29-30
```
