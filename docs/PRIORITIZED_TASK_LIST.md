- ‚úÖ **Excellent test coverage (974 tests, 100% passing)** ‚≠ê NEW!
- ‚úÖ Database persistence working (v3 schema)
- ‚úÖ Riverpod state management properly implemented
- ‚úÖ Multiple Bible translations loaded
- ‚úÖ Spanish localization complete
- ‚úÖ **FTS5 full-text search implemented** ‚≠ê NEW!

### Gaps:
- ‚ö†Ô∏è UI-to-service connections missing (Prayer, Settings)

- ‚ö†Ô∏è AI is fallback-only (Phi-3 Mini integration in progress)
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Zero accessibility (no Semantics widgets)
- ~~‚ö†Ô∏è Test coverage unknown~~ ‚úÖ FIXED - 974 tests passing!
- ~~‚ö†Ô∏è RVR1909 Bible file missing~~ ‚ùå CANCELLED - not needed

## Notes & Recommendations

### AI Strategy Decision Required:
The LocalAIService currently uses sophisticated fallback responses with:
- Theme detection from user input
- Relevant Bible verse integration
- Context-aware response templates
- Performance monitoring

**Options:**
1. **Ship with fallback** - It works well, users won't know the difference
2. **Add cloud API** - More intelligent, requires internet and API costs
3. **Local Llama** - True local AI, but 2-3 weeks of work + 1GB+ app size

**Decision:** Implementing Phi-3 Mini 3.8B INT4 (~500 MB) for true local AI with excellent quality/size balance.

### Missing Spanish Bible:
RVR1909 is referenced but file missing. Quick fix:
```bash
# Download from Bible API or Crosswire
# Add to assets/bible/rvr1909.json
# Already integrated in code!
```

### ‚úÖ Test Coverage: COMPLETE
Run tests with:
```bash
flutter test  # All 974 tests pass!
```

Key achievements:
- Fixed 24 failing tests (app providers, devotional progress, widget tests, bible loader)
- Enabled 8 skipped tests (FTS search, Google Fonts with mocking)
- Added comprehensive coverage for all services and providers
- 100% pass rate maintained

### Time to Launch Estimate:
- Sprint 1 (P0): **3-5 days** ‚Üê Critical!
- Sprint 2 (P1): **1-2 weeks**
- Sprint 3 (P2): **1-2 weeks**
- Sprint 4 (Launch): **1 week**

**Total: 3-5 weeks to production-ready v1.0**
