## üìù Response Structure

All responses follow a consistent 4-part structure:

1. **Empathy acknowledgment** - Validates the user's struggle
2. **Biblical truth** - Provides theological grounding
3. **Scripture citation** - WEB Bible verse with reference
4. **Hope statement** - Points toward healing and God's presence

### Example Response

**User Input:** "I'm struggling with depression and can't feel God anymore"

**Response:**
```
I hear the weight of what you're experiencing. Isaiah 41:10 says:
"Don't be afraid, for I am with you. Don't be dismayed, for I am
your God. I will strengthen you. Yes, I will help you. Yes, I will
uphold you with the right hand of my righteousness." God is with
you in this struggle, even when it doesn't feel like it.
```

## üîç Theological Validation

### ‚úÖ Passed Checks

1. **Prosperity Gospel** - 0 instances found
   - No "name it and claim it"
   - No "seed faith" or "sow to receive"
   - No "God wants you rich"

2. **Spiritual Bypassing** - 0 instances found
   - No "just pray harder"
   - No "just have more faith"
   - No "God won't give you more than you can handle"

3. **Toxic Positivity** - 0 instances found
   - No "don't be sad"
   - No "just think positive"
   - No "everything happens for a reason" (dismissive)

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Known Limitations

1. **Verse Contextual Relevance**
   - Keyword-based matching sometimes selects verses that aren't contextually perfect
   - Example: Leviticus ritual laws appearing for modern life struggles
   - **Impact:** Medium - Verses are still biblically accurate, just not always most relevant
   - **Mitigation:** Manual curation of top 500 examples recommended

2. **Response Template Repetition**
   - 5 empathy statements rotated across 19,750 examples
   - 5 hope statements rotated across 19,750 examples
   - **Impact:** Low - Natural variation exists, but AI should learn more diverse patterns
   - **Mitigation:** Fine-tuning will allow AI to generate more varied responses

3. **Professional Referrals Not Included**
   - Mental health, addiction, eating disorder themes don't include referrals
   - **Impact:** Medium - Need to add referral integration post-training
   - **Mitigation:** ReferralService.dart already built (Phase 1)

## üéì Training Data Format

### TensorFlow LSTM Training Format

Training data is converted to simple text format for local LSTM model training:

```
USER: I'm struggling with anxiety and can't sleep
RESPONSE: I hear the weight of what you're experiencing. Philippians 4:6-7 says: "In nothing be anxious, but in everything, by prayer and petition with thanksgiving, let your requests be made known to God. And the peace of God, which surpasses all understanding, will guard your hearts and your thoughts in Christ Jesus." You're not alone in this, and there is hope for healing and peace.

USER: I feel so alone and have no friends
RESPONSE: Thank you for sharing something so personal. Psalm 68:6 says: "God sets the lonely in families. He brings out the prisoners with singing, but the rebellious dwell in a sun-scorched land." God is with you in this struggle, even when it doesn't feel like it.
```

### Structured JSONL Format (for analysis)

Each line is a JSON object with this structure:

```json
{
  "messages": [
    {"role": "system", "content": "System prompt"},
    {"role": "user", "content": "User input"},
    {"role": "assistant", "content": "AI response"}
  ]
}
```
